# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Heart disease is a major global health concern, and preventing it has become more critical than ever. Data-driven systems that predict heart disease can enhance the prevention and treatment process — helping more people lead healthier lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play.

This project analyzes a heart disease dataset, applies preprocessing techniques, and builds various classification models using popular ML algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease.
